It is built for users who want a streamlined approach to start working with their datasets effectively.

## ⚙ Features
- Data cleaning (missing values, outliers, etc.)
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Data splitting for training/testing
- Exploratory data analysis steps (optional)

## 📦 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
